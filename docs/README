COMPILING
*********

By default, the build system included with this framework
compiles for a multinode, HPC environment, assuming access to MPI
compilers built on the GNU g++ compiler.  Simply type "make" in the
code directory to build with the default options.  

If the framework will be running on a single node, or personal machine,
a minor change to the compile-time arguments list is needed to remove
the dependencies on MPI.  Type "make PLAT=seq" to make a sequential 
version of the framework.

Both versions of the framework also include a compiler tool for 
debugging.  This can be built by adding `debug CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror"`
to either of the above compile options, i.e. make PLAT=seq debug CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror"
or make debug CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror".

Running
*******

New users should do a first run with "./OWEFexec -h" to print the help page.
Alternatively, you may view the OWEF_help.txt file to see what options are 
appropriate for your job. The framework is designed to execute the full
pipeline from a single instance, but does take advantage of threading
and multiple nodes (when available).
